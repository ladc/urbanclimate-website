For the annual Day of Science, a Science Festival was organized at Brussels' MuntPunt library. On 24 November 2024, science fans of all ages played the revamped LEGO urban climate game and learned about climate adaptation and AI through play.

This year, we also investigated the __impact__ of the game on understanding climate change, climate adaptation, and participants' attitudes towards science. We based our methods on those developed by [IMPACTLAB](https://impactlab.sites.uu.nl/). Keep an eye on the website for the results of this research!
