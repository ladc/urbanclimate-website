With the support of Innoviris, we were able to significantly upgrade and expand our workshop for this edition of the I Love Science Festival. The 4 beautiful new LEGO temperature boxes attracted a lot of attention and participants.

Many children were able to design their climate-resilient city in LEGO and immediately visualize the impact on temperature. Through the creative process of building and testing, children learn about the impact of land use on the temperature in their city.

It was a fantastic edition, with many enthusiastic children and parents participating in the workshop. We are already looking forward to the next edition!
