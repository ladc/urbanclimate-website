## Urban heat island

Summary: The urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon where urban areas are warmer than their rural surroundings. This is due to the high concentration of buildings, roads and other infrastructure that absorb and retain heat. The UHI can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of urban residents, as well as on the environment.
